configuration update

major updates:
added a configuration bar
added fucked up saving/loading
added this changelog

minor changes:
added shamelessness (cupofdirtfordinner hyperlink)
removed equals sign from shelter crafting (formerly "26 stone + 1 door -> shelter")
changed the ammount shelters sell for

saving barely works. tools dont work right for some reason (i coded those in a scuffed way so ima have to redo that really soon) AND it doesnt save in a cookie either and i really have no idea why. kinks will be ironed out eventually, but i might as well push what i have since i havent updated this in like a week
update: tools started working upon restarting chrome. i still have to recode them though
